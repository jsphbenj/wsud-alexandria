PROCESS STEPS

In the Anaconda Command Prompt:
    1. Read the all_roads.shp file
    2. Printed all columns to figure out relevant fields
        ["full_id", "osm_id", "osm_type", "alt_name_e", "name_en", "oneway", "geometry", "highway"]
    3. Deleted all other fields
    4. Clipped the roads to each microbasin
    5. Calculated Line Bearings (azimuths) for each street within each microbasin
        5.1. Created line_bearing(gdf)
    6. Calculate Bins in MB Layers
        6.1. Read bin_key.csv and create dictionary based off of it
    7. Create Polar Histogram using bins in basin_bins
    8. Calculated Ho and Phi and saved them in basin_bins_analysis
        Ho: Street Orientation Entropy
        Phi: Orientation-Order Indicator
        based on Urban spatial order (Boeing 2019).
